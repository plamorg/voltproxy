# Load balancing can be used to distribute requests to multiple service endpoints.

services:
  myLoadBalancer:
    host: lb.example.com
    loadBalancer:
      # Optionally enable session persistence (implemented with cookies).
      # If this is set, cookies will be used to ensure a client will keep connecting to the same server.
      # Cookies are overriden if the service fails health check.
      persistent: true # Default: false.

      strategy: random # Can be random, roundRobin, or failover. Default: roundRobin.
      # random: choose a random service from the pool.
      # roundRobin: choose service in a cyclic manner.
      # failover: always choose the first service (still respects health checks).
